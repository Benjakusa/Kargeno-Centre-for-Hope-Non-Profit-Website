            <h1>Get Involved</h1>

        </div>
        <div class="get-involved-content">
            <p>Our program educates individuals on HIV prevention, testing, and treatment options, as well as available contraception methods. We work to reduce the stigma surrounding HIV/AIDS in Kenya, helping communities understand that education, prevention, and care are essential in fighting the epidemic. The impact has been compelling—participants gain vital knowledge and are empowered to make informed health decisions.</p>
            <p>In addition, we focus on supporting disadvantaged young girls aged 8-16, who are often denied opportunities in education, employment, and leisure due to societal norms. Many of these girls face early marriage and pregnancy, often encouraged to leave school as their families cannot afford rising school fees. We aim to break this cycle by empowering girls with education and instilling confidence in them that their future is not limited to marriage and motherhood.</p>
            <p>The program also addresses menstrual health, providing sanitary products to girls who cannot afford them. The lack of these essentials often forces girls to stay home from school, impacting their education and self-esteem. By supplying sanitary products and fostering a supportive environment, Kar Geno helps girls stay in school and build their futures with confidence.</p>
            <p>In addition to our school-based initiatives, we extend health education to the homes of individuals already infected with HIV or unable to attend school. This holistic approach ensures that health awareness and prevention reach as many people as possible.</p>
            <p>We invite health professionals and those with experience in public health to join us as volunteers. Your expertise can make a life-changing difference in rural Kenya, as health education is a powerful tool in saving lives and improving well-being across communities.</p>
